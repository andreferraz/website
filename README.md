# André Ferraz

Hello, this is the code from my personal website/portfolio, developed with **Next.js**.

## Technologies I used

-  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – A React framework
-  [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) – A CSS framework for responsive websites
-  [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) – A library for component based styling
-  [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) – An awesome CLI for creating code from a custom boilerplate

## Run it locally

> It requires **NPM** and **Node.js** to run on your machine.

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once running, you can visit http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
